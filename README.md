Caledar and planner made using React, hooks, localStorage, TypeScript and Sass. 

Fully responsive application which shows actual year, month and day as in calendat. For day schedule you can add and delete tasks (also with priority) or set day off. Color of the day change depend on tasks/day off. Planner sort tasks starting with priority. Another main feature is making notes. You can add them or delete on the right side of screen. Application is saving data in localstorage, so you can refresh app without losing them. 

For simplicate I set every month for 30 days.
